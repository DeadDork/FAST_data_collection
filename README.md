FAST_data_collection
====================

The repo name is very misleading. Apologies in advance.

This project is not about quick data collection, but rather about generating data for one-time research purposes. The research in question is a safety study I am conducting at the medical clinic I work at. Being investigated are a number of different diet treatments, one of which is water-only fasting--which is how the study got the horrible acronym FAST.

In particular, the code in this repository takes years and years worth of daily patient update emails (stored across a number of .mbox files), and distills and compiles these into one simple table. The data in the emails is organized in table formats that have undergone a lot of tweaking by the clinicians here, which makes the task at hand herculean (not slaying-the-hydra-herculean, but rather like cleaning-the-Augean-stables-herculean). The reason I am putting this up on git is because I need good revision control while putting together a scripts that will output good data from a bad source.

Calling it text mining is like calling my dreams of flying into space a rocket ship.

I can't imagine anybody wanting to look through this repo, let alone wanting to use any of my code. It's ugly ugly ugly. Still, it's my baby. It brings to mind Anna Bradstreet's poem "The Author to her Book":

Thou ill-formed offspring of my feeble brain,
Who after birth did'st by my side remain,
Till snatcht from thence by friends, less wise than true,
Who thee abroad exposed to public view,
Made thee in rags, halting to th' press to trudge,
Where errors were not lessened (all may judge).
At thy return my blushing was not small,
My rambling brat (in print) should mother call.
I cast thee by as one unfit for light,
The visage was so irksome in my sight,
Yet being mine own, at length affection would
Thy blemishes amend, if so I could.
I washed thy face, but more defects I saw,
And rubbing off a spot, still made a flaw.
I stretcht thy joints to make thee even feet,
Yet still thou run'st more hobbling than is meet.
In better dress to trim thee was my mind,
But nought save home-spun cloth, i' th' house I find.
In this array, 'mongst vulgars may'st thou roam.
In critic's hands, beware thou dost not come,
And take thy way where yet thou art not known.
If for thy father askt, say, thou hadst none;
And for thy mother, she alas is poor,
Which caused her thus to send thee out of door.

So, be kind, and don't make fun! If you somehow manage to squeeze use for my work, let me know! It will totally make my day.
