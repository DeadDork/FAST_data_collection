FAST_data_collection
====================

This repo name is sooooo misleading. Apologies in advance.

This project is not about quick data collection, but rather is a safety study I am conducting at the medical clinic I work at. Being investigated are a number of different treatments, one of which is water-only fasting, and the protocol uses the horrible acronym FAST. That said, the code in this repository is meant to collect and compile into an easy to review and analyze table format years and years worth of daily patient updates sent over email. The data in the emails is organized in table formats that have undergone a lot of tweaking by the clinicians here. The reason I am putting this up on git is because I need good revision control while putting together a decent set of scripts to spit out good data.

Calling it text mining is like calling my dreams of flying into space a rocket ship.

I can't imagine anybody wanting to look through this repo, let alone wanting to use any of my code. It's ugly ugly ugly. Still, it's my baby. It brings to mind Anna Bradstreet's poem "The Author to her Book":

Thou ill-formed offspring of my feeble brain,
Who after birth did'st by my side remain,
Till snatcht from thence by friends, less wise than true,
Who thee abroad exposed to public view,
Made thee in rags, halting to th' press to trudge,
Where errors were not lessened (all may judge).
At thy return my blushing was not small,
My rambling brat (in print) should mother call.
I cast thee by as one unfit for light,
The visage was so irksome in my sight,
Yet being mine own, at length affection would
Thy blemishes amend, if so I could.
I washed thy face, but more defects I saw,
And rubbing off a spot, still made a flaw.
I stretcht thy joints to make thee even feet,
Yet still thou run'st more hobbling than is meet.
In better dress to trim thee was my mind,
But nought save home-spun cloth, i' th' house I find.
In this array, 'mongst vulgars may'st thou roam.
In critic's hands, beware thou dost not come,
And take thy way where yet thou art not known.
If for thy father askt, say, thou hadst none;
And for thy mother, she alas is poor,
Which caused her thus to send thee out of door.
